# JMS Example

First, install ActiveMQ. If you work on student machines, follow the guide in  [activemq-install.md](activemq-install.md).

## Task 01

Run git clone https://github.com/misostc/jms-example.git

Run `git checkout -f step1`

Your task is to implement according to the TODOs a Consumer based on Activemq which will receive a text message and print it to System.out. There is already an application skeleton containing an implementation of a Producer which sends the message you need to receive.

## Task02

Run `git checkout -f step2`

You will find solution to task01 there. Your task is to rewrite the current solution to use JNDI. 

1.	Write jndi.properties (found in /resources)
2.	Continue according to the TODOs found in /src

You can run `git checkout -f step3` to see if your solution was right.

## Task03
Run `git checkout -f step4`

There is an implementation of a publisher which sends different messages to different topics. 
Look to the implementation of Publisher to see which two Topics are used. 
Your task is to create 2 Subscribers for each of them. Use Spring to create the subscribers. 

You can run `git checkout -f step5` to see if your solution was right.

Merry Christmas and happy new year!
